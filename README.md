- **Sensitivity Multiplier:** Multiplies the mouse movement by a certain coefficient.
- **Gain Switch:**Allows the application of the shape of the acceleration graph.
- **Offsets:** Determines the speed threshold at which acceleration will come into play.
- **Caps:** Allows the acceleration to stop after a certain limit.
- **Anisotropy:** Provides the ability to define sensitivity to horizontal and vertical movements separately.

### Acceleration Styles

Raw Accel offers a variety of acceleration styles. There are different styles suitable for each game and user:

- **Linear:** Is the simplest and most user-friendly acceleration style.
- **Classic:** Is the classic acceleration style used especially in games like Quake.
